This repository contains projects and examples that utilize OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. OpenCV provides various functions and tools for image and video processing, object detection, machine learning, and more.

## Installation

To get started with OpenCV, follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system:

- [OpenCV Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) for Linux
- [OpenCV Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d0/d3d/tutorial_general_install.html) for Windows
- [OpenCV Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/db/d64/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html) for macOS

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies and configure your development environment before proceeding.

## Projects

### 1. Drawing Functions

The `drawingFunctions` project demonstrates various drawing functions available in OpenCV. It includes examples of drawing lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, and adding text to images.

To run the project, navigate to the `drawingFunctions` folder and execute the main Python file:

```sh
cd drawingFunctions
python drawingFunctions.py
```

### 2. Image ROI

The `imageROI` project explores the concept of Region of Interest (ROI) in image processing. It showcases how to select specific regions in an image and perform operations on those regions.

To run the project, navigate to the `imageROI` folder and execute the main Python file:

```sh
cd imageROI
python imageROI.py
```

### 3. Object Detection

The `objectDetecting` project focuses on object detection using OpenCV. It includes examples of detecting objects and features in images using pre-trained models and algorithms.

To run the project, navigate to the `objectDetecting` folder and execute the main Python file:

```sh
cd objectDetecting
python objectDetecting.py
```

### 4. Thresholding

The `thresholding` project explores different thresholding techniques in OpenCV. It includes examples of image binarization, adaptive thresholding, and Otsu's thresholding.

To run the project, navigate to the `thresholding` folder and execute the main Python file:

```sh
cd thresholding
python tresholding.py
```

Feel free to explore other projects and examples in this repository. Each project folder contains a `README.md` file with further instructions and details.
